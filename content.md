## About Travel Wizard

We are a technology-driven company focused on transforming the way people plan vacations. Many people find it challenging to organize the perfect trip due to time constraints, overwhelming options, and a lack of clarity about destinations. Travel Wizard aims to solve this problem by leveraging the power of AI. Users simply provide their preferences—favorite activities, desired destinations, budget, and more—and our AI algorithm generates custom vacation packages tailored to their unique needs. But we go beyond planning. We partner with travel agencies, airlines, and hotels to book your entire trip, including accommodations, flights, and activities. All this is packaged in an easy-to-use platform, where you can manage bookings and make changes effortlessly. Whether it’s a relaxing getaway or an adventurous expedition, Travel Wizard ensures a seamless travel experience.
